          Over the next 16 weeks I’m going to take up some space in your
          newsfeed to reflect on my experiences participating in the first
          TechNative Digital Full Stack Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          While I’m sure many of you in the tech and education communities are
          aware of bootcamps and what they do – this particular programme is
          rather different.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          It aims to shake up both the tech and education sectors by working
          directly with employers to reduce skills gaps, give opportunities to
          individuals outside traditional entry routes and promote the
          importance of diversity within the tech sector.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          As one of the lucky nine to make the cut, I’m sharing my experiences
          on the project to showcase TechNative’s approach to industry training
          and, hopefully, show the benefits of making space in tech, and other
          industries, for people like me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          On paper I look like a pretty terrible choice for most of the
          positions available in this industry. I, however, think I’d be great
          in a developer role and have a lot of wider knowledge that could
          benefit the industry, a thought TechNative clearly share!

              By far the most exciting thing this week is finding out I’ve been
              shortlisted for interviews at the companies attached to the
              bootcamp! Don’t get me wrong, it’s a tough group to be up against
              which is also a little scary but I’ve picked some very me outfits
              for the interviews and I’m trying to prep my little heart out.
              Wish us all luck!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Content wise, I really enjoyed the last week. I feel pretty happy
              with the testing stuff we covered (although a bit more practise
              actually implementing some tests would be great). I’ve managed to
              get my backend API projects tidied up too, so feeling a bit more
              confident there too.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I also got a chance to go back and spend a bit of time on React
              and get my ‘React Playground’ a bit more functional. It’s sure as
              hell not pretty yet (I didn’t have THAT much time), but I’ve now
              played with all the main features. I was really grateful to have
              had another course member’s project to use as a guide and proud
              that I managed to develop on the ideas in it such as filtering
              props that had been passed down through components (rather than
              just at the top level) and creating a countdown clock!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have been absolutely LOVING SQL/Postgres this week too and have
              been steaming through the content quite quickly. It probably helps
              that I’ve done so much data related stuff in Excel with PowerQuery
              and VBA, but it just feels really natural. I’m just getting to the
              point of designing databases myself and it’s been hard to take
              some time out from it to write this because I just want to play
              with it! It’s going to be my treat for later…
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We’ve had some really great guest speakers this week too. One was
              an impromptu discussion with someone who does testing for their
              job, which was particularly enlightening. While I’ve always
              understood the value of testing, it’s always felt a little outside
              of scope at the moment because using tests hasn’t been embedded
              into the learning we’re doing and everywhere does it differently.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’d come to the idea that it’s good to be aware of testing, but
              I’ll probably focus on it a little more when I get into work and
              understand their set up better. But this talk changed that
              perspective a bit for me and my biggest take away was to use tests
              as a form of learning, especially when you’re looking at other
              people’s code! If you’re struggling to understand it, runs some
              tests on it to unpick what different sections are actually doing.
              I’d not really thought about this before and I really love the
              curiousness espoused by this testing concept.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Chatting to Sim and Katie about their jobs in UX and development
              strategy were also really interesting. I’d love to get better at
              website design – this site could definitely do with a bit of a
              facelift! Hearing about what goes into designing a project was
              interesting too, it’s certainly a process that I’d love to be able
              to get involved in once I’m settled in my role.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It’s been great to get insights into all the areas involved in
              development and has really enforced my interest in the industry –
              not just the building, but how all the pieces of the puzzle fit
              together. While I’ve always had a bit of an idea as to the other
              jobs in the sector, I have been exposed to so many things I hadn’t
              considered. I do love having things like this to mull over.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Hopefully I can get involved in the wider process wherever I end
              up working. On that note, it’s time to do some interview prep. A
              huge good luck to the rest of the cohort with interviews – if I’m
              not lucky this time round, I’ll be so proud of whoever gets the
              roles! It really is anyone’s game!

            <p>
              This has been a bit of a special week for me. Although my face has
              been hurting from my wisdom tooth extraction last Friday, I got a
              little taste of my dream developer life while working remotely and
              dog sitting for a friend in London. There’s something so freeing
              about being able to work efficiently in different environments.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy being in an office – I love the
              camaraderie, bouncing ideas off each other and just generally
              feeling in the thick of it. I have, however, learnt that being in
              that environment all the time (e.g. Mon-Fri 9-5) takes a toll on
              me after a while and it’s important for me to have some work time
              to myself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The balance of this offered by a career in software development is
              a huge factor in my career change. Hybrid working is an absolute
              must for me, for so many reasons. It also plays into so many of my
              other interests: problem solving, learning systems, making things
              and being creative. I thought a lot about which direction to pivot
              in and I just kept coming back to software.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And this week, I could taste what I’m working towards. It was
              incredibly affirming that I’m on the right path to creating a life
              that I actually want, rather than one I’ve fallen into.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It’s not all been roses though! The modules we’ve looked at this
              week have been quite dense to get through and I feel like I’ve hit
              the two thirds slump – when you’ve done so much and you’re ready
              for this chapter to end to start the next one. Thankfully it’s
              something I’ve experienced many times, so I’ve got a few tricks up
              my sleeve to help.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the most significant changes I made was going back to my
              HalfBold Chrome extension. I’d taken it off early in the course
              because it’s a bit janky with some of the Codecademy pages (you
              initially get an error page and have to refresh to get the content
              to show), but at the moment it’s a price I’m willing to pay! It’s
              made a huge difference to my ability to take in content and made
              the second half of the week much smoother.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve also been making sure that I’m spending my breaks swapping up
              the style of activity I’m doing. Coding is a very static, brain
              heavy activity so stretching or doing a quick chore has been
              important to allow me to switch off for a bit and come back to
              learning a bit fresher. I used to have 5-minute poi breaks every
              60-90 minutes during my last work project (and that would be my
              ideal!) but I don’t have the space for that at the moment.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve been quite enjoying the experience of backend so far. It’s
              mainly been Express Routing and OAuth which I’ve found
              conceptually simple to grasp, but as always, I’m struggling a
              little with the finer function logic. I get there eventually, it’s
              just slower than I’d like! It’s high on my practise list when I
              get a bit more time to focus on it. I’m REALLY looking forward to
              starting databases though, so bring on this week!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Rounding off the week I had my second mentor chat, which was
              incredibly helpful. I was initially a little sceptical, but it’s
              quickly become one of my favourite aspects of the TechNative
              bootcamp. I’ve learnt so much about myself since I last changed
              jobs/companies and getting advice on things like the recruitment
              process, handling the transition into a new company and clarifying
              expectations and boundaries has been invaluable.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We’re just waiting to find out which of our cohort have been
              successful in securing the jobs attached to this bootcamp now. I
              must say – I’m a little nervous. It honestly could be any of us,
              it’s such a strong pool of candidates! But at least I feel a
              little better prepared for the job search if this isn’t my
              opportunity. I’d just love to know so I can get the rest of my
              ducks in order. Fingers crossed!!

              The absolute highlight of the week was getting together in person
              for the project 2 presentations. It was so wonderful to get to
              speak positively about a presentation and demonstrate what we’d
              been able to teach each other by working together. I really think
              the fun and communication shone through to the group of employers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I was also incredibly impressed by the rest of my course mates.
              One of the groups had a tough time with workflow and communication
              but presented fairly and honestly. I was so impressed with how
              they didn’t let the negatives get them down, as I had last
              project, and have seemed able to brush themselves off and carry
              on. I have a lot to learn from that grace!

            <br />
            <p>
              Equally, others in the group who had not been so confident at the
              start were presenting with a confidence that blew me away. It’s
              awesome to see the change in her over the past 10 weeks.
              Considering her technical prowess, she’s going to be a powerhouse
              in the workplace!

              Following our presentations, we had 10-minute conversations with
              employees from both DabApps and CertN. These were a little scary,
              but I think I presented myself well and I enjoyed getting to ask
              some more questions about both companies. It’s safe to say we were
              all pretty shattered by the end of it though. Presenting yourself
              in such a way is quite exhausting, I’m glad I don’t have to do it
              all the time!

            <p>
              <strong>Well done everyone!</strong> Including the employers for
              being so friendly and helping to put us at ease.

              I’m super excited to have started on Backend this week. While
              working through Node and Express JS isn’t the most exciting thing
              in the world, it’s been straightforward so far. I imagine it’ll
              change when we actually start coding it rather than just reading.
              What I’m most excited for is starting databases and this only
              intensified after our guest speaker this week!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It was really cool to hear from someone working with, quite
              frankly, enormous datasets. Their management, architecture and the
              additional considerations (GDPR) is really interesting to me. I
              think this stems from creating my own (fairly basic) CRMs at my
              last job and being involved in their digital transformations team
              to roll out a digital workflow across the whole organisation.
              Definitely something I’m looking forward too!

              I took Friday off this week as I had my wisdom tooth out.
              Thankfully, it’s all gone well (the last one was a disaster) and
              I’ve been grateful to be able to take a little time back after
              such a busy period. I’ve rested well over the weekend and am ready
              to come back fresh Monday for more Express!

              It’s safe to say my anxiety going into this week was thoroughly
              misplaced. Not only have we put together a site that I feel truly
              proud of, its been an absolute blast making it! It’s also really
              lovely to write a blog post that feels like a celebration, rather
              than unpicking the challenges of the week. A huge, huge thank you
              to my group mates for making this a possibility.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After getting the brief on Monday, we spent the entire day
              chatting and planning. As you know, I’d been concerned that my
              technical abilities were going to be a bit lacking during this
              project, but I am so glad I brought it up. It gave us all a chance
              to discuss our technical strengths, weaknesses and areas we wanted
              to improve. This allowed us to plan our workflows to support our
              learning needs, such as agreeing to do the more challenging
              aspects with Async API calls and Thunks is group coding sessions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I feel like I really got a chance to shine when it came to
              breaking down the project. One of my group admitted to being a
              little intimidated by it and wasn’t sure where to start. After
              talking about my weakness, it was empowering to have a moment that
              I could say “oh, this is one of my superpowers – are you guys
              happy for me to lead this?” (thankfully, they were).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              That’s not to say I broke it all down myself, rather we went
              through the site page by page, then section by section to
              determine what tasks we’d need to complete. While we were
              confident we’d get the mandatory and extra tasks done, we agreed
              to prioritize the three mandatory pages first and come back to the
              products page as our top priority backlog.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After the challenges with code reviews and prioritisation in my
              last group, I suggested we used a traffic light system for both
              reviews and backlog tasks. I think the rest of my group initially
              thought it was a bit superfluous, and it was for code reviews
              which we far less nitty and more constructive than before, but it
              really came into its own when addressing our backlog tasks towards
              the end of the week.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The actual code writing itself was a dream. We did the same thing
              as before and sat on an all-day call, which made troubleshooting
              or making code decisions quick and easy. On Tuesday and Wednesday,
              we found that we naturally fell into a pattern of solo coding in
              the morning and group coding in the afternoon. This worked so well
              for us that we had the basis for all the mandatory sections of the
              site finished by midday Wednesday, so we could comfortably move
              onto analysing the products page together in the afternoon.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Almost all of Thursday and Friday were spent working
              collaboratively on the final Thunk and API call we needed, before
              combing through the site – mainly on the front end to tidy up and
              improve the UX and UI. I really loved iterating through the site
              in this way, improving it more each time we combed over it as
              opposed to the expectation of perfection from the off. We had the
              chance to really talk about the changes we were suggesting, rather
              than having them dictated.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I was also really proud that I managed to suggest fixes during the
              Async parts of the coding. While I’ve read the material, I need a
              lot more practice to feel confident writing it so those couple of
              moments we’re really affirming that I’ve actually learnt more than
              I’d realised. The groups reactions and praise when my changes
              worked meant so much.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My final take away was how much fun we were able to have during
              the course of this project. I really loved that we’ve put together
              a very professional looking site, with incredibly nerdy and silly
              content. If someone had an idea about the site that made us laugh,
              it got incorporated in a way that made sense. It really reminded
              me of theatre improvisation groups – always say “yes”! As a
              result, I feel like the site really reflects our collective
              personality – something I think is vital in a portfolio piece.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This week has really affirmed what I expect from group work – good
              communication, support and a bit of fun. If you can prioritise
              these things, the workflow will fall into place and you will
              naturally create something wonderful. A huge thank you to Team
              Dagron – I’ve really appreciated the support and silliness. I’m
              really excited to present this project with you on Tuesday!

              As predicted, not a whole lot got done on holiday and it took me a
              few days to recover when I got back (sharing a house with 15 other
              people for 10 days is a little overwhelming at times, but lots of
              fun was had). So, this entry has ended up as a delayed reflection
              on an entire course block covering React and Redux and will
              probably be a bit shorter than usual because it’s less fresh in my
              mind!

              Week 7 was really long for me. I didn’t get a lot of notice for
              the amount of material I’d need to cover while I was away and I
              was really feeling the pressure. I did the best I could in terms
              of time management, but there’s only so much you can do with fixed
              deadlines and fixed scope. In the end, I averaged 12-hour days
              during the week and skipped the majority of extra practise content
              so I could ensure I’d seen all the content I needed for the next
              group project when I got back.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I won’t lie – I was already pretty frazzled by the end of that
              week and felt like I only had an overview understanding of the
              technologies. It wasn’t really an ideal situation to be in going
              into another group project, especially considering the stresses of
              the last one, and it felt me feeling pretty anxious over the
              subsequent weeks. I ended up spending a lot of time just trying to
              keep myself as calm as I could about it all.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Despite the stress, anxiety and overwhelm, there were a couple of
              wins that came out of week 7:
            </p>
            <ul class="body-list">
              <li>
                I managed to explain the point (and use cases) for mocking tests
                and where it lived in Jest code to one of my peers. It gave me a
                boost that I’d picked up more than I realised.
              </li>
              <li>
                I started planning my About Me project and used ChatGPT as a
                sounding board for it. I was REALLY proud of myself for getting
                quite a complex project largely broken down and sense checked in
                about 2 hours! I tried starting to code it but had to give up
                because I realised I needed some more controlled practise first
                to solidify my understanding. It’s ready and waiting in my
                backlog though!
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Thursday and Friday after my return, however, were probably
              two of the most important days of the bootcamp for me so far. Our
              guest speaker, my mentor and Pete all said or called me on
              different things that made me realise that I’ve been putting far
              too much pressure on myself. I wasn’t being kind to myself,
              believing in my abilities or putting myself first and that had to
              change. You can read my LinkedIn post about it here.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              So, I did the previously unthinkable and took the entire weekend
              off. I rested. I stepped away from the pressures of the course and
              trying to demonstrate, at every stage, that I’m employable. I
              allowed myself to accept that I just wasn’t going to be able to
              get everything done that was expected of me. I reminded myself
              that I’m changing my life. I’m not just learning new skills; I’m
              learning a whole new industry. Which means I’m also re-learning
              how to balance new needs and priorities with my own personal
              needs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And honestly, for a while here – I’ve not been getting it right.
              I’ve been forgetting the ‘superpowers’ I already have, the ones
              that got me a spot on this bootcamp in the first place. I’m not
              going to be the strongest coder for React or Redux, but I’m a
              great manager. I’m really good at iterating through big projects
              and breaking them down into smaller tasks. I’m honest,
              communicative, and organised. Group projects aren’t all about the
              code – they’re also about demonstrating these skills.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              With that in mind, I’m moving into week 10 with the following
              goals:
            </p>
            <ul class="body-list">
              <li>
                Appreciate the skillset I already have and try to let that
                shine.
              </li>
              <li>
                Try to get a better understanding of exactly how much I
                understand of React/Redux and where I need more practise.
              </li>

              And with that our first group project is done! Monday was spent
              trying to crack out the last few mandatory sections of code. I’ll
              be honest - it felt a bit touch and go as to whether we’d finish,
              which was quite stressful, and we had to reassign sections of
              tasks to keep things moving – but we did it! To say I was relieved
              when the last section got merged at 3pm would be an
              understatement.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Overall, I think we’ve done a great job for a four-day project –
              the site is well optimised for different devices, the code base is
              pretty clean, and everything works like it should. There are a few
              things to tidy up, like the hover states for the tabs and the
              scoping of some of the CSS but it’s pretty minor in the grand
              scheme of things.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The only thing I was a little disappointed with was that we didn’t
              get any further than the mandatory components. There was scope to
              have a products page with a JavaScript filter and to create a
              hamburger menu for mobile devices – both of which I would have
              loved to try (particularly the hamburger menu). I was so impressed
              to see that both other groups had gotten fully functional products
              pages coded and one had a working (albeit temperamental) hamburger
              menu!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I think the main reason we didn’t get here was the huge amount of
              time dedicated to code reviews and making tiny changes to the way
              things were written. While I very much appreciated the attention
              to detail and some of the bugs caught, I think a bit more balance
              was needed here to help prevent blocks in workflow and ensure that
              we were all writing code as much as possible. It also had the
              knock-on effect of making me feel like I wasn’t trusted to make
              reasonable code decisions, thus making me question my own
              abilities.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              While there was push back on aspects of this, such as nits vs
              actual problems, I wonder if I should have instigated a wider
              conversation about the effects I was seeing on morale and
              workflow. It’s a fine line, everyone has their own idiosyncrasies
              that need to be worked around and little blocks are to be expected
              from this. At what point does the balance of these different
              working practices become untenable and need to be addressed more
              directly? It’s not that any particular approach is wrong, it’s
              more about understanding each other and ensuring we’re working
              together rather than against each other. I’d love to hear your
              thoughts on this!

              I was actually quite nervous going into the presentations on
              Tuesday and I feel like I fumbled through my section (the website
              demo) a little. In hindsight, it probably wasn’t the best section
              for me to pick – having never done or seen a website demo before,
              but hey ho! I definitely need to remember to slow down and
              breathe, something I’m usually really good at. Mind you, I do I
              usually feel more confident in my knowledge of the subject I’m
              presenting as I tend to have been in a field longer than six
              weeks!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              All in all, it’s been a really interesting and informative
              project. I’ve got a lot to think about coming out of it and in
              preparation for the next one in a few weeks’ time. I’m really
              proud of the site we put together and in absolute awe of the other
              groups (I know they’ll have had their weaknesses too, but damn
              they achieved so much). I’m also very grateful that I’ve been able
              to get some quality alone time during the rest of the week after
              such an intense few days of people-ing!

            <br />
            <p>
              Just like that, we’ve wrapped up on HTML, CSS and vanilla
              JavaScript! During the latter part of the week we’ve been starting
              on React, which is hugely exciting. It’s giving me lots of
              inspiration for this site and the basics have seemed fairly
              straight forward. Sadly, I am having to rush through the content a
              little faster than I’d like to compensate for going holiday soon
              and as such I’m not getting the freer practice I need to get it a
              bit more embedded in my brain. But needs must – at least I’ll have
              seen it!

              I’m hoping I’ll be able to keep up with this blog over the next
              few weeks, but I’m going to be in America for 10 days from
              Saturday for a wedding! I’ve got A LOT of course material to try
              and cover, as well as making sure I get some down time to enjoy
              myself and explore, so you’ll have to excuse if the schedule gets
              a little squiffy or I have to miss a week entirely. I promise to
              share a few pictures on my LinkedIn to make you all jealous!

              If you’d like to see our group project, you can access it via the
              projects link in the nav bar and then scrolling down to Week 6.
              You could even stay a little while and peruse some of the other
              projects I’ve done through the course to see how far I’ve come –
              spoiler: I’ve come a LONG way in 6 weeks! Hopefully this blog is a
              testament to that too. Thanks for reading and I’ll catch you up
              again soon.

              My biggest take away from the early part of the week is
              remembering to move on when I’m stuck on Codecademy! I tried to
              stick out doing a project and ended up more confused than when I
              started. I should probably have gone straight to Pete’s additional
              tasks and played there for a little while first.

              Our second face to face day on Wednesday was wonderful. It was so
              lovely to see everyone in person again, we even got to have a beer
              (or two) together afterwards. To me, getting that social downtime
              together is so important. I feel like I’m getting to know everyone
              a bit better, and I really appreciated getting to have proper
              conversations with some of the group members who are quieter in
              meetings.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The group project itself has been a very big exercise in
              compromise. There’s quite a big discrepancy in technical ability
              in the group (with myself at the lower end) and communication has
              been challenging at times. I got a bit frustrated on Wednesday
              afternoon when a complex filing system was proposed which, after
              nearly an hour of asking questions about, I just didn’t
              understand.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This frustration was obviously picked up on by other group members
              but did lead to an honest conversation about our technical
              background differences which helped to reset some assumptions. It
              wasn’t the last conversation of this ilk over the week: with
              others on workflow, perfection of code and time management coming
              over the next few days.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Working in a group is rarely easy. What I am forever grateful for
              is the grace and patience with which my entire group has met our
              differing approaches. Yes, there’s been difficult conversations
              and hard-fought compromises, but not one flat-out argument. We’ve
              been blunt with each other, but we’ve apologised for poor phrasing
              and clarified rationales when we’ve need to. We’ve been looking
              out for each other in our own, very different, ways and we’ve
              always continued working.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              While I’ve had a lot of experience working in and managing groups,
              this experience has helped me to consider more carefully how I
              want to approach this in the future. I’ve been reflecting on times
              when I’ve not been as constructive as I could have been and,
              alongside the experiences of this week, I’ve come up with the
              following guide:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul class="body-list">
              <li>
                Before you request a change to a project, consider how important
                it is in the grand scheme of things. Is it a Must (major issue),
                Should (e.g. best practice) or Could (largely superficial or
                prettying).
              </li>
              <li>When requesting/suggesting a change:</li>
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>
                  Be clear how important you feel it is and why, so you and the
                  team can best discuss it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Only major issues should completely block a project moving
                  forwards. Should and Could changes might get added to an
                  appropriate workflow stack for later so priority tasks can be
                  finished.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you want a change, offer a solution and rationale. If you
                  don’t know the solution, say so and request some time
                  (priority dependant) to find one!
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Keep feedback, rationales and solutions as simple as possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be aware of the pitfalls of certain approaches, but don’t make
                them a problem unless they actually are! You could end up down a
                rabbit hole you never needed to be down in the first place.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              After jumping on and off video calls for most of the first
              morning, we decided to stay on a call throughout the day and it
              was a really great experience. I found it made me much better at
              asking a quick question when I was stuck, and I could get opinions
              on approaches or small additional changes immediately. We
              generally had cameras and mics off, so it wasn’t constant chatter,
              but we were all there in the background when we needed each other.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The only downside was that I accidentally made one of my teammates
              jump out of his skin a few times when I came back on mic after a
              period of silence! The workaround? When I unmute now the group
              gets an ascending ‘do, do, do, do’ or similar before I start
              speaking. It’s given us all a few laughs and me more joy that I
              should probably admit!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Finally, a huge thank you to the Milliways group for being
              wonderful humans through all of this. We’ve got a day left on
              Monday, followed by presentations on Tuesday. I can’t wait to show
              you what we’ve created. Wish us luck!

              After a frustrating end of last week and start of this week,
              things are finally starting to click into place a little more. I’m
              definitely still struggling when comparing more complex objects,
              but I’m starting to be able to solve the challenges (even if the
              code is bloated as hell to get there)! I’ve even found myself
              refactoring things as I’ve been going along occasionally.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the things that helped most with this was actually seeing
              some JavaScript (JS) debugging in action during a freer project on
              Tuesday. We’d been given instructions on how to do a number of
              different things with JS and HTML and after following the first
              set pretty closely to get a feel for it, I decided to merge in the
              next set (skipping a couple of repetitive bits) straight into my
              current code base rather than repeating things I’d already done.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Sounds great right? Except something really wasn’t working and
              objects weren’t appearing when they should be. After clearing Dev
              Tools of all its errors and going through my latest code sections
              with a fine-tooth comb, I was still none the wiser. So, I jumped
              on a call with Pete who also couldn’t easily spot an issue!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The process that Pete took me through next, of going completely
              back to basics and console logging each piece of code in turn, was
              a revelation. Within 5 minutes we’d found a piece of code from the
              start of the project (that had displayed as expected so I hadn’t
              spotted or even considered) to be causing the fault. Having seen
              it in action, it’s now a vital part of my JS toolbox and, I think,
              is a big factor in the progress I’ve made this week.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In addition to a whole new bunch of JS, we’ve also been come back
              round to Git, GitHub and VS Code. Having skipped ahead a little
              for this blog I was already fairly comfortable with most of this,
              but it did give the opportunity to play with Git Workflow with a
              few of my colleagues which was really cool! We’d all only ever
              used it solo so, while we’d seen things like branches and pull
              requests, we’d never really played with them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Cue us all editing the README document at the same time, creating
              pull requests for the changes and generating a bunch of merge
              errors! I think we’d all assumed it would be like Glitch, so as
              long as we inputted on different lines it’d be fine… Oh, how wrong
              we were. It was good practice for us all to debug the problem
              together and we all had a go at manually editing and merging each
              other’s documents.
            </p>
            <br />

              As we had a little time left before the retrospective, we decided
              to look at the Codecademy group project “Mixed Messages”.
              Initially it seemed a bit daunting, but after chatting through
              some ideas about how we could code it we decided we could knock
              something simple out for it. I got a little bit too excited
              introducing Trello, but I think everyone was on board with its
              use, and we had fun colour coding and assigning cards before
              getting down to our respective tasks.

              All in all, it was a successful Wednesday afternoon and set me up
              well for our guest speaker, Chris Boakes, on Thursday. It was
              interesting to hear how larger companies use GitHub, manging
              pipelines and pull requests, as well as better understanding how
              developers get to input into the design process for projects. My
              favourite take aways were to ‘apply for jobs with stacks that your
              interested in, not necessarily ones you have’ and to understand
              that having the fundamentals of a language down makes learning and
              swapping between frameworks a lot easier.

              Friday was a real high point for me, I’m still floating a little
              if I’m honest. I had a really successful 121 with Pete to discuss
              progress and goals for the course, which are the same as those
              I’ve identified for myself during the process of writing this
              blog. It was also the first day I felt like I could look at harder
              JS challenges and not completely freak out. To top it all off, I
              managed to help someone else in the group with a piece of HTML/CSS
              code that wasn’t working! It’s the first time that’s happened,
              despite looking at lots of the issues people post in the group, so
              feels like quite a milestone.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We’ve got a couple of days doing a bit more JS next week and then
              we’re onto our first group project, set by DabApps and CertN,
              which means a face-to-face day on Wednesday! I’m really looking
              forward to it, although I’m a little nervous doing the people
              thing after so long behind a screen. Yes - even those of us who
              appear extroverted get a little socially anxious from time to
              time! If I’m lucky maybe a couple of people will join me for a
              ‘social’ at the end of the day too – good team relationships are
              important after all!

            <p>
              This week has seen the introduction of JavaScript to our
              toolboxes. The initial stages were pretty simple but by the time
              we got to Advanced Objects things were getting trickier. Although
              I’m pretty happy with all the concepts in isolation putting them
              together into freer projects has been REALLY challenging. I think
              my new nemesis is comparing items nested in arrays or unnamed
              objects!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve realised that I need to pair back my thinking when it comes
              to JavaScript. Having been in roles that require a lot of
              multi-tasking I’ve gotten very good at combining and chaining
              tasks. This week I’ve really learnt how deadly this style of
              thinking is in coding and how much I assume the links I can see
              are obvious (spoiler – they’re not!).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To try and re-train this a bit, I’ve made myself a ‘Challenge
              Process’ to follow for each new activity. It sounds so obvious,
              and I already do this in so many other areas of my life, but it’s
              really helped my last two challenges! It goes as follows:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul class="body-list">
              <li>Write a clear goal that your code is trying to achieve.</li>
              <li>
                Make a list of the main things your code needs to do to achieve
                the goal.
              </li>
              <li>Go through the list again.</li>
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>What sub steps are there for each point on the list?</li>
                <li>
                  If you’re writing multiple functions, this could be what the
                  individual functions need to do.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Guess what? Go over it again! Can you make it any more granular?
              </li>
              <li>Flag areas you think you’ll struggle with.</li>
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>
                  When you get to these tasks, set a timer (I’m currently
                  testing out 15 minutes).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timer goes off and you’re still on the task – walk
                  away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On returning, set another timer and work through the steps you
                  took, the ones you need and check syntax.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timer goes off and you’re no further ahead – GET HELP!
                  This could be asking ChatGPT or getting a fresh pair of eyes
                  from a colleague.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              It’s still a work in progress (I keep forgetting timers) but you
              know what they say, practise makes perfect! Or at least better.
              I’ll absolutely settle for better right now!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve really enjoyed some of the chats we’ve had within the group
              this week – sharing frustrations with syntax and vocabulary
              differences, for example swapping to American English or what I
              know as dictionaries being called objects. Quite a few of my bugs
              have been from a missing semi-colon or forgetting to set an
              iterator with let. This is now the first thing I check, so that
              part of debugging is getting significantly faster at least!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Our guest speaker this week is heavily involved in AI, something I
              don’t know a huge amount about but am very excited to learn. While
              they were very knowledgeable and passionate about the area, I
              found the sheer amount of technical information presented
              difficult to follow and I struggled to relate it to my current
              practice.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There’s a piece of the puzzle missing but, to be honest, I’m not
              quite sure what it is yet! I really hope that their next
              appearance helps clear things up a little, or at least helps point
              me in the right direction.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My final excitement of the week is starting to play with Trello!
              I’ve been aware of the application for a couple of years now, but
              it’s taken until this week’s Tips and Tricks session for me to get
              a bit more of an introduction. I’ve currently got two boards
              running, one for the course and one for this website project. I’ll
              let you know how I get on!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve not had much chance to play with this site’s code this week,
              although I have been reading up on and am hoping to have a go
              implementing BEM soon. I also want to do a bit of a re-jig of the
              structure to switch my code to mobile first design… Fingers
              crossed my new challenge process helps me get through my work a
              bit quicker next week!

              I’m not quite sure how I made it through this week but I can tell
              you our tutor, Pete, was a big part of it. From helping me
              untangle the mess I’d made trying to set up my GitHub and VS Code
              to his words of encouragement as I was somewhat bombarded with
              personal issues – he’s been a god send. By Thursday morning, it’s
              safe to say my resilience had worn rather thin: I was feeling
              behind, stressed and the heath markers for my ME/CFS were all
              starting to head in the wrong direction. I was on the edge of
              wondering if I’d bitten off a bit more than I could chew, but some
              kind words and a decent rest have made a huge difference. While
              I’m still a little fatigued writing this on Monday, I’m feeling
              better prepared for the week ahead.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Personal and health issues aside, week two exposed me to some of
              the content I’d been waiting to see in CSS around creating layouts
              and responsive sites. Grid and Flexbox came fairly easily (both
              now integrated into this sites design – Grid for the global page
              layout and Flexbox to structure individual page’s content). I’m
              pretty happy with the concept of media queries as another feature
              for creating responsive sites, but I think I need a bit more time
              playing with these and Dev Tools to completely grasp them. There’s
              only one on this site at the moment, to swap the green bar between
              the side and top of the main content, but I’m sure more will
              follow as I add more features. Please do give me a shout if you
              come across any more break points I’ve missed though!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On Monday I spent a couple of hours with Pete addressing my GitHub
              and VS Code confusions from last week, which was so enlightening!
              While I’d pretty correctly understood how all the programmes
              worked together, my issues were coming from having set everything
              up higher up the file tree than I should have – rather than having
              everything linked to my entire project bucket, I needed to think
              of Repos and Workspaces as individual projects. It may sound
              simple and obvious, but for someone who is used to working from a
              wider viewpoint it wasn’t! With that said, I have chosen to
              implement my filing a little differently to many of my peers.
              Rather than having lots of project folders and repos for my
              individual projects, I have two main sources – one for this
              site/blog and another for the projects I do through the bootcamp.
              Each has an index page that links to the other pages within each
              source, setting each up a little more like its own website. It’s
              allowed me to play with having a global stylesheet to make this
              blog site and the homepage of my course projects a lot more
              cohesive and easier for you to explore!

              The highlight of the week was definitely the guest speaker, Cal.
              It was really affirming to hear from someone who had recently
              changed careers into software development – through the same
              Codecademy course no less! There’s a lot I could relate to in
              Cal’s story – wanting to move into the industry for the
              flexibility but having had a varied career before. I was a little
              jealous of the projects he’s been able to work on too – a Surfer’s
              Against Sewage app and a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) that
              generates bespoke courses based on limited input. I’ve always had
              quite a strong connection with learning and social conscience
              arenas, which is why I’d ended up in the roles I’ve had. I wasn’t
              sure how much a career in tech would allow me to engage in these
              kinds of areas so between hearing about these projects and finding
              the Green Software meet up, I’m feeling even more excited for what
              could be in my future!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It was also interesting to hear that the hardest part of the swap
              for him was getting used to the office environment and the
              different wellbeing needs attached to it, rather than the code
              itself. I guess I’m going through that process myself at the
              moment too – although I’ve worked in an office before, my
              environment has changed a lot over the last few months and I’m
              having to rebalance my needs around it as well as those of this
              course. As we’ve seen from this week, it isn’t always successful,
              but at least I’m getting used to assessing my needs and adjusting
              to the environment already! Now I’ve just got to try and put a
              little less pressure on myself… Let’s see if I can manage that in
              week 3!

              So, I’ll move onto the first week! Not only have we covered four
              Codecademy modules, but we also had a whole day in-person meet,
              our first pair coding challenges and two supplementary content
              sessions. If I had to describe it in one word, it’d definitely be
              ‘intense’. Working through the Codecademy course was a bit of a
              mixed bag – the content is well thought out, engaging and
              progresses you well through the different stages of the learning
              process (explicit instructions, followed by guided tasks to help
              embed skills). However, I’d already covered two out of four
              modules in my preparation for the course and it was a little
              tedious doing the exact same content. That being said, I was also
              a little glad as I think I would have fallen behind if I was
              seeing it brand new and trying to make decent notes. I took longer
              to go through the modules I hadn’t seen, especially as it related
              to software I hadn’t used before, and I was grateful they were
              much smaller than the previous ones. I must say I am a little
              nervous how I’ll cope when we start some of the more complicated
              topics, but I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t up for the challenge!

              The thing that most surprised me this week was the introduction of
              a pair/group coding challenge so early into the programme. While
              I’d heard of it before from friends in the industry, I was quite
              nervous about how it would work in practice. After all, we’ve all
              been in those horrible group situations where groups don’t gel and
              workflow gets stunted. My nerves turned out to be quite unfounded.
              The day quickly became my favourite of the week, and I learnt a
              lot from my colleagues as well as better understanding how
              everyone worked, myself included. I know now that I prefer a fully
              collaborative approach, where the whole group discusses the same
              piece of code together and responsibility for typing moves around
              regularly, even if it can be a bit slower. Not every group I was
              in worked like that, but neither did we discuss exactly how we’d
              conduct the session. With that in mind I prepared two points to
              discuss when first starting in any pair coding situation: how
              comfortable do you feel with this code aspect and how are we going
              to agree to work? The former will allow me to see how active of a
              role I should be taking (e.g. if I’m more experienced, give the
              other person a chance to work it out before offering suggestions),
              while the latter will set clear expectations and hopefully prevent
              focus being pulled off into a variety of directions. I look
              forward to trying these out!

              Our usual weekly timetable has three supplementary content
              sessions in, two workshops and a guest speaker, although we
              dropped one workshop this week on account of it being the first
              week. It was really useful to hear about working in the software
              industry from someone actually working in it and our speaker this
              week, Mike Allanson, has around 20 years of experience to draw
              from. Although we discussed a lot of interesting points, my
              personal take aways were having a ‘tinker’ website to try out new
              technologies and ideas on, using AI as a look up tool for big
              technical documents, the importance of showing your ability to
              learn on your CV and a great approach to debugging that I’m
              excited to try out. Getting an insight into the differences
              between smaller and larger companies confirmed that what I had
              experienced within my wider career was still applicable within the
              tech industry, but I can imagine it was new and useful information
              for some of my cohort with a little less work experience to draw
              from.

              From our Tips, Tools and Tricks session, I’m looking forward to
              exploring Markdown for note taking. At the moment, I’m doing
              everything in Word or GoogleDocs because I like that I can format
              information in tables and headers, making it easy to read and
              navigate quickly (not unlike webpages in may respects). It’s a bit
              of a shame there doesn’t seem to be much space for personal
              research projects within the bootcamp scheme, but I understand
              that time is tight and there’s a lot of important content to
              cover. I also get the feeling I have more things I’m behind on
              than some of the others – the first day in the slack chats was a
              bit like trying to read a foreign language at times. It’s gotten
              better as the week has gone on and I’ve been exposed to more
              things - I’m sure it’ll continue to improve!

              As you can imagine, coming to write this on Friday evening my
              brain is more than a little fried but there’s also a huge smile on
              my face thinking about all we’ve achieved. And it really feels
              like a ‘we’ already. My days always start and end with the group
              in ‘standups’ and ‘retrospectives’ where we set our workload for
              the day, share how we’re getting on and even present additional
              projects in a great piece of learner differentiation. There’s a
              huge emphasis on no-one getting too far ahead or behind, mainly to
              keep the team projects equal, but it’s also helping to create a
              sense of camaraderie. I wouldn’t say it’s fully developed yet - I
              know I’ve fallen foul of being too nervous to post in Slack when
              I’m stuck on something (like today using VS Code and GitHub for
              the first time). Pete, our tutor, has been great at leading
              celebrations of success by giving out ‘internet points’ and has
              been encouraging us to use each other’s knowledge as a resource,
              but actively acting on that might take a little more time (it is
              week one after all!).
            </p>

            <p>
              This really is such a different experience from the other
              bootcamps I’ve experienced, both personally and through my old
              clients, where 100+ people work through online content in
              isolation. I think it’s pretty clear that I am getting so much
              from the additional content being covered, even at this early
              stage. For now, I’m ready to get my head down and have a decent
              rest over the weekend so I can be bright eyed and bushy-tailed by
              the time you’re reading this early next week!
