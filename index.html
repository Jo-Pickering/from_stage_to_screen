          Over the next 16 weeks I’m going to take up some space in your
          newsfeed to reflect on my experiences participating in the first
          TechNative Digital Full Stack Bootcamp.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          While I’m sure many of you in the tech and education communities are
          aware of bootcamps and what they do – this particular programme is
          rather different.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          It aims to shake up both the tech and education sectors by working
          directly with employers to reduce skills gaps, give opportunities to
          individuals outside traditional entry routes and promote the
          importance of diversity within the tech sector.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          As one of the lucky nine to make the cut, I’m sharing my experiences
          on the project to showcase TechNative’s approach to industry training
          and, hopefully, show the benefits of making space in tech, and other
          industries, for people like me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="intro">
          On paper I look like a pretty terrible choice for most of the
          positions available in this industry. I, however, think I’d be great
          in a developer role and have a lot of wider knowledge that could
          benefit the industry, a thought TechNative clearly share!

              This week has seen the introduction of JavaScript to our
              toolboxes. The initial stages were pretty simple but by the time
              we got to Advanced Objects things were getting trickier. Although
              I’m pretty happy with all the concepts in isolation putting them
              together into freer projects has been REALLY challenging. I think
              my new nemesis is comparing items nested in arrays or unnamed
              objects!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve realised that I need to pair back my thinking when it comes
              to JavaScript. Having been in roles that require a lot of
              multi-tasking I’ve gotten very good at combining and chaining
              tasks. This week I’ve really learnt how deadly this style of
              thinking is in coding and how much I assume the links I can see
              are obvious (spoiler – they’re not!).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To try and re-train this a bit, I’ve made myself a ‘Challenge
              Process’ to follow for each new activity. It sounds so obvious,
              and I already do this in so many other areas of my life, but it’s
              really helped my last two challenges! It goes as follows:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul class="body-list">
              <li>Write a clear goal that your code is trying to achieve.</li>
              <li>
                Make a list of the main things your code needs to do to achieve
                the goal.
              </li>
              <li>Go through the list again.</li>
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>What sub steps are there for each point on the list?</li>
                <li>
                  If you’re writing multiple functions, this could be what the
                  individual functions need to do.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>
                Guess what? Go over it again! Can you make it any more granular?
              </li>
              <li>Flag areas you think you’ll struggle with.</li>
              <ul class="sub-list">
                <li>
                  When you get to these tasks, set a timer (I’m currently
                  testing out 15 minutes).
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timer goes off and you’re still on the task – walk
                  away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  On returning, set another timer and work through the steps you
                  took, the ones you need and check syntax.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the timer goes off and you’re no further ahead – GET HELP!
                  This could be asking ChatGPT or getting a fresh pair of eyes
                  from a colleague.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
              It’s still a work in progress (I keep forgetting timers) but you
              know what they say, practise makes perfect! Or at least better.
              I’ll absolutely settle for better right now!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve really enjoyed some of the chats we’ve had within the group
              this week – sharing frustrations with syntax and vocabulary
              differences, for example swapping to American English or what I
              know as dictionaries being called objects. Quite a few of my bugs
              have been from a missing semi-colon or forgetting to set an
              iterator with let. This is now the first thing I check, so that
              part of debugging is getting significantly faster at least!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Our guest speaker this week is heavily involved in AI, something I
              don’t know a huge amount about but am very excited to learn. While
              they were very knowledgeable and passionate about the area, I
              found the sheer amount of technical information presented
              difficult to follow and I struggled to relate it to my current
              practice.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There’s a piece of the puzzle missing but, to be honest, I’m not
              quite sure what it is yet! I really hope that their next
              appearance helps clear things up a little, or at least helps point
              me in the right direction.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              My final excitement of the week is starting to play with Trello!
              I’ve been aware of the application for a couple of years now, but
              it’s taken until this week’s Tips and Tricks session for me to get
              a bit more of an introduction. I’ve currently got two boards
              running, one for the course and one for this website project. I’ll
              let you know how I get on!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I’ve not had much chance to play with this site’s code this week,
              although I have been reading up on and am hoping to have a go
              implementing BEM soon. I also want to do a bit of a re-jig of the
              structure to switch my code to mobile first design… Fingers
              crossed my new challenge process helps me get through my work a
              bit quicker next week!

              I’m not quite sure how I made it through this week but I can tell
              you our tutor, Pete, was a big part of it. From helping me
              untangle the mess I’d made trying to set up my GitHub and VS Code
              to his words of encouragement as I was somewhat bombarded with
              personal issues – he’s been a god send. By Thursday morning, it’s
              safe to say my resilience had worn rather thin: I was feeling
              behind, stressed and the heath markers for my ME/CFS were all
              starting to head in the wrong direction. I was on the edge of
              wondering if I’d bitten off a bit more than I could chew, but some
              kind words and a decent rest have made a huge difference. While
              I’m still a little fatigued writing this on Monday, I’m feeling
              better prepared for the week ahead.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Personal and health issues aside, week two exposed me to some of
              the content I’d been waiting to see in CSS around creating layouts
              and responsive sites. Grid and Flexbox came fairly easily (both
              now integrated into this sites design – Grid for the global page
              layout and Flexbox to structure individual page’s content). I’m
              pretty happy with the concept of media queries as another feature
              for creating responsive sites, but I think I need a bit more time
              playing with these and Dev Tools to completely grasp them. There’s
              only one on this site at the moment, to swap the green bar between
              the side and top of the main content, but I’m sure more will
              follow as I add more features. Please do give me a shout if you
              come across any more break points I’ve missed though!
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              On Monday I spent a couple of hours with Pete addressing my GitHub
              and VS Code confusions from last week, which was so enlightening!
              While I’d pretty correctly understood how all the programmes
              worked together, my issues were coming from having set everything
              up higher up the file tree than I should have – rather than having
              everything linked to my entire project bucket, I needed to think
              of Repos and Workspaces as individual projects. It may sound
              simple and obvious, but for someone who is used to working from a
              wider viewpoint it wasn’t! With that said, I have chosen to
              implement my filing a little differently to many of my peers.
              Rather than having lots of project folders and repos for my
              individual projects, I have two main sources – one for this
              site/blog and another for the projects I do through the bootcamp.
              Each has an index page that links to the other pages within each
              source, setting each up a little more like its own website. It’s
              allowed me to play with having a global stylesheet to make this
              blog site and the homepage of my course projects a lot more

              The highlight of the week was definitely the guest speaker, Cal.
              It was really affirming to hear from someone who had recently
              changed careers into software development – through the same
              Codecademy course no less! There’s a lot I could relate to in
              Cal’s story – wanting to move into the industry for the
              flexibility but having had a varied career before. I was a little
              jealous of the projects he’s been able to work on too – a Surfer’s
              Against Sewage app and a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) that
              generates bespoke courses based on limited input. I’ve always had
              quite a strong connection with learning and social conscience
              arenas, which is why I’d ended up in the roles I’ve had. I wasn’t
              sure how much a career in tech would allow me to engage in these
              kinds of areas so between hearing about these projects and finding
              the Green Software meet up, I’m feeling even more excited for what
              could be in my future!

              It was also interesting to hear that the hardest part of the swap
              for him was getting used to the office environment and the
              different wellbeing needs attached to it, rather than the code
              itself. I guess I’m going through that process myself at the
              moment too – although I’ve worked in an office before, my
              environment has changed a lot over the last few months and I’m
              having to rebalance my needs around it as well as those of this
              course. As we’ve seen from this week, it isn’t always successful,
              but at least I’m getting used to assessing my needs and adjusting
              to the environment already! Now I’ve just got to try and put a
              little less pressure on myself… Let’s see if I can manage that in
              week 3!

              So, I’ll move onto the first week! Not only have we covered four
              Codecademy modules, but we also had a whole day in-person meet,
              our first pair coding challenges and two supplementary content
              sessions. If I had to describe it in one word, it’d definitely be
              ‘intense’. Working through the Codecademy course was a bit of a
              mixed bag – the content is well thought out, engaging and
              progresses you well through the different stages of the learning
              process (explicit instructions, followed by guided tasks to help
              embed skills). However, I’d already covered two out of four
              modules in my preparation for the course and it was a little
              tedious doing the exact same content. That being said, I was also
              a little glad as I think I would have fallen behind if I was
              seeing it brand new and trying to make decent notes. I took longer
              to go through the modules I hadn’t seen, especially as it related
              to software I hadn’t used before, and I was grateful they were
              much smaller than the previous ones. I must say I am a little
              nervous how I’ll cope when we start some of the more complicated
              topics, but I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t up for the challenge!

              The thing that most surprised me this week was the introduction of
              a pair/group coding challenge so early into the programme. While
              I’d heard of it before from friends in the industry, I was quite
              nervous about how it would work in practice. After all, we’ve all
              been in those horrible group situations where groups don’t gel and
              workflow gets stunted. My nerves turned out to be quite unfounded.
              The day quickly became my favourite of the week, and I learnt a
              lot from my colleagues as well as better understanding how
              everyone worked, myself included. I know now that I prefer a fully
              collaborative approach, where the whole group discusses the same
              piece of code together and responsibility for typing moves around
              regularly, even if it can be a bit slower. Not every group I was
              in worked like that, but neither did we discuss exactly how we’d
              conduct the session. With that in mind I prepared two points to
              discuss when first starting in any pair coding situation: how
              comfortable do you feel with this code aspect and how are we going
              to agree to work? The former will allow me to see how active of a
              role I should be taking (e.g. if I’m more experienced, give the
              other person a chance to work it out before offering suggestions),
              while the latter will set clear expectations and hopefully prevent
              focus being pulled off into a variety of directions. I look
              forward to trying these out!

              Our usual weekly timetable has three supplementary content
              sessions in, two workshops and a guest speaker, although we
              dropped one workshop this week on account of it being the first
              week. It was really useful to hear about working in the software
              industry from someone actually working in it and our speaker this
              week, Mike Allanson, has around 20 years of experience to draw
              from. Although we discussed a lot of interesting points, my
              personal take aways were having a ‘tinker’ website to try out new
              technologies and ideas on, using AI as a look up tool for big
              technical documents, the importance of showing your ability to
              learn on your CV and a great approach to debugging that I’m
              excited to try out. Getting an insight into the differences
              between smaller and larger companies confirmed that what I had
              experienced within my wider career was still applicable within the
              tech industry, but I can imagine it was new and useful information
              for some of my cohort with a little less work experience to draw
              from.

              From our Tips, Tools and Tricks session, I’m looking forward to
              exploring Markdown for note taking. At the moment, I’m doing
              everything in Word or GoogleDocs because I like that I can format
              information in tables and headers, making it easy to read and
              navigate quickly (not unlike webpages in may respects). It’s a bit
              of a shame there doesn’t seem to be much space for personal
              research projects within the bootcamp scheme, but I understand
              that time is tight and there’s a lot of important content to
              cover. I also get the feeling I have more things I’m behind on
              than some of the others – the first day in the slack chats was a
              bit like trying to read a foreign language at times. It’s gotten
              better as the week has gone on and I’ve been exposed to more
              things - I’m sure it’ll continue to improve!

              As you can imagine, coming to write this on Friday evening my
              brain is more than a little fried but there’s also a huge smile on
              my face thinking about all we’ve achieved. And it really feels
              like a ‘we’ already. My days always start and end with the group
              in ‘standups’ and ‘retrospectives’ where we set our workload for
              the day, share how we’re getting on and even present additional
              projects in a great piece of learner differentiation. There’s a
              huge emphasis on no-one getting too far ahead or behind, mainly to
              keep the team projects equal, but it’s also helping to create a
              sense of camaraderie. I wouldn’t say it’s fully developed yet - I
              know I’ve fallen foul of being too nervous to post in Slack when
              I’m stuck on something (like today using VS Code and GitHub for
              the first time). Pete, our tutor, has been great at leading
              celebrations of success by giving out ‘internet points’ and has
              been encouraging us to use each other’s knowledge as a resource,
              but actively acting on that might take a little more time (it is
              week one after all!).
            </p>

            <p>
              This really is such a different experience from the other
              bootcamps I’ve experienced, both personally and through my old
              clients, where 100+ people work through online content in
              isolation. I think it’s pretty clear that I am getting so much
              from the additional content being covered, even at this early
              stage. For now, I’m ready to get my head down and have a decent
              rest over the weekend so I can be bright eyed and bushy-tailed by
              the time you’re reading this early next week!
