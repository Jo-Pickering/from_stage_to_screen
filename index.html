      <h3>TechNative Digital Bootcamp Reflections</h3>
      <p>
        Over the next 16 weeks I’m going to take up some space in your newsfeed
        to reflect on my experiences participating in the first TechNative
        Digital Full Stack Bootcamp. While I’m sure many of you in the tech and
        education communities are aware of bootcamps and what they do – this
        particular programme is rather different. It aims to shake up both the
        tech and education sectors by working directly with employers to reduce
        skills gaps, give opportunities to individuals outside traditional entry
        routes and promote the importance of diversity within the tech sector.
        As one of the lucky nine to make the cut, I’m sharing my experiences on
        the project to showcase TechNative’s approach to industry training and,
        hopefully, show the benefits of making space in tech, and other
        industries, for people like me. On paper I look like a pretty terrible
        choice for most of the positions available in this industry. I, however,
        think I’d be great in a developer role and have a lot of wider knowledge
        that could benefit the industry, a thought TechNative clearly share!

          So, I’ll move onto the first week! Not only have we covered four
          Codecademy modules, but we also had a whole day in-person meet, our
          first pair coding challenges and two supplementary content sessions.
          If I had to describe it in one word, it’d definitely be ‘intense’.
          Working through the Codecademy course was a bit of a mixed bag – the
          content is well thought out, engaging and progresses you well through
          the different stages of the learning process (explicit instructions,
          followed by guided tasks to help embed skills). However, I’d already
          covered two out of four modules in my preparation for the course and
          it was a little tedious doing the exact same content. That being said,
          I was also a little glad as I think I would have fallen behind if I
          was seeing it brand new and trying to make decent notes. I took longer
          to go through the modules I hadn’t seen, especially as it related to
          software I hadn’t used before, and I was grateful they were much
          smaller than the previous ones. I must say I am a little nervous how
          I’ll cope when we start some of the more complicated topics, but I
          wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t up for the challenge!
        </p>

        <p>
          The thing that most surprised me this week was the introduction of a
          pair/group coding challenge so early into the programme. While I’d
          heard of it before from friends in the industry, I was quite nervous
          about how it would work in practice. After all, we’ve all been in
          those horrible group situations where groups don’t gel and workflow
          gets stunted. My nerves turned out to be quite unfounded. The day
          quickly became my favourite of the week, and I learnt a lot from my
          colleagues as well as better understanding how everyone worked, myself
          included. I know now that I prefer a fully collaborative approach,
          where the whole group discusses the same piece of code together and
          responsibility for typing moves around regularly, even if it can be a
          bit slower. Not every group I was in worked like that, but neither did
          we discuss exactly how we’d conduct the session. With that in mind I
          prepared two points to discuss when first starting in any pair coding
          situation: how comfortable do you feel with this code aspect and how
          are we going to agree to work? The former will allow me to see how
          active of a role I should be taking (e.g. if I’m more experienced,
          give the other person a chance to work it out before offering
          suggestions), while the latter will set clear expectations and
          hopefully prevent focus being pulled off into a variety of directions.
          I look forward to trying these out!
        </p>

        <p>
          Our usual weekly timetable has three supplementary content sessions
          in, two workshops and a guest speaker, although we dropped one
          workshop this week on account of it being the first week. It was
          really useful to hear about working in the software industry from
          someone actually working in it and our speaker this week, Mike
          Allanson, has around 20 years of experience to draw from. Although we
          discussed a lot of interesting points, my personal take aways were
          having a ‘tinker’ website to try out new technologies and ideas on,
          using AI as a look up tool for big technical documents, the importance
          of showing your ability to learn on your CV and a great approach to
          debugging that I’m excited to try out. Getting an insight into the
          differences between smaller and larger companies confirmed that what I
          had experienced within my wider career was still applicable within the
          tech industry, but I can imagine it was new and useful information for
          some of my cohort with a little less work experience to draw from.

          From our Tips, Tools and Tricks session, I’m looking forward to
          exploring Markdown for note taking. At the moment, I’m doing
          everything in Word or GoogleDocs because I like that I can format
          information in tables and headers, making it easy to read and navigate
          quickly (not unlike webpages in may respects). It’s a bit of a shame
          there doesn’t seem to be much space for personal research projects
          within the bootcamp scheme, but I understand that time is tight and
          there’s a lot of important content to cover. I also get the feeling I
          have more things I’m behind on than some of the others – the first day
          in the slack chats was a bit like trying to read a foreign language at
          times. It’s gotten better as the week has gone on and I’ve been
          exposed to more things - I’m sure it’ll continue to improve!
        </p>

        <p>
          As you can imagine, coming to write this on Friday evening my brain is
          more than a little fried but there’s also a huge smile on my face
          thinking about all we’ve achieved. And it really feels like a ‘we’
          already. My days always start and end with the group in ‘standups’ and
          ‘retrospectives’ where we set our workload for the day, share how
          we’re getting on and even present additional projects in a great piece
          of learner differentiation. There’s a huge emphasis on no-one getting
          too far ahead or behind, mainly to keep the team projects equal, but
          it’s also helping to create a sense of camaraderie. I wouldn’t say
          it’s fully developed yet - I know I’ve fallen foul of being too
          nervous to post in Slack when I’m stuck on something (like today using
          VS Code and GitHub for the first time). Pete, our tutor, has been
          great at leading celebrations of success by giving out ‘internet
          points’ and has been encouraging us to use each other’s knowledge as a
          resource, but actively acting on that might take a little more time
          (it is week one after all!).
        </p>

        <p>
          This really is such a different experience from the other bootcamps
          I’ve experienced, both personally and through my old clients, where
          100+ people work through online content in isolation. I think it’s
          pretty clear that I am getting so much from the additional content
          being covered, even at this early stage. For now, I’m ready to get my
          head down and have a decent rest over the weekend so I can be bright
          eyed and bushy-tailed by the time you’re reading this early next week!
