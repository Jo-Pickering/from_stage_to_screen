#Title: From Stage to Screen

 ##Description
 A place for me to put into practice and play with new concepts while I'm learning. 
 It's constantly being updated and the aim is that it will serve as a 'tinker site' for when I'm a full fledged developer.

 ##Features
 + The current index page hosts a blog about my journey on a guided Full-Stack Bootcamp hosted by TechNative Digital. 
 + The index also links out to other repos that host practice projects from various streams so you can see my progress going along.
 + Eventually I'll be adding more pages (e.g. home and about) to flesh out the site.

 ##How to use
 Feel free to browse through my code and see what you think!  You can also see the page deployed on GitHub pages.

 ##Notes
 Anything content on these pages is my own opinion on my learning and experiences.
