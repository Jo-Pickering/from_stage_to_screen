        Hi, I'm Jo and I'm an aspiring software developer. If you couldn't tell
        from the title, it's been an interesting journey to get to where I am -
        so I thought I'd share the process with you all as one of my projects.
        Hopefully I can be a little ray of light for others who started out in a
        COMPLETELY different industry and show you that non-STEM backgrounds are
        just as capable in software development.

<p>
        For those of you reading who don’t know me – I’m an arts graduate
        (theatre, if you couldn’t guess from the blog title!) with an MA in
        International Relations. For the last 6 years I’ve been working in the
        refugee support sector, focusing on entry to employment. Besides a few
        hodge podge projects in VBA and a little Python from a bootcamp I didn’t
        get to finish, I have no demonstrable tech experience or qualifications.
        Hell, I’ve not even touched a STEM subject (an essential requirement for
        apprentice and junior roles) since GCSE and they were more years ago
        than I’d care to admit!
